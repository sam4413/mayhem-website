# Rust Rules:

- Team size limits: This a QUAD max for teams server.
- Rules regarding sharing: You can only share with your quad team. No bagging in "extra" players.
- Ban evasion: Players who circumvent server bans by using alternate accounts are usually banned again.
- No advertising other servers: Promoting competing servers or communities is typically prohibited.
- No real-world politics or religion: To maintain a peaceful environment, discussions about real-world political or religious topics may be discouraged or prohibited.
- Be respectful: Avoid harassment, trolling, racism, or prejudice.
- No cheating or exploiting: This includes using hacks, macros, or exploiting glitches.
- No griefing: Don't intentionally ruin others' fun or progress.
- Kill on Sight (KOS) is allowed. Please just don't continually grief a player.
- No raiding starter bases: Avoid raiding newly established or clearly beginner bases.
- Protect your base: Build a secure base to store your loot, place doors with locks (code locks are recommended), and authorize your tool cupboard to prevent unauthorized building. We do have a offline deterrent, but it just makes it so an offline cost more.
- Don't trust everyone: Many players in Rust will try to kill you, even if they seem friendly at first.
