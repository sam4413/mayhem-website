## Welcome to Mayhem Scrapyard Plus

**NOTE: This is a PvE Server: Absolutely no fighting, looting, or theft of other player's grids will be tolerated. This is a Supportive Community - it's us, all together, against the environment - take your fight elsewhere.**

Scrapyard is a salvage-focused survival experience where players have restricted build options and must rely on looting and capturing damaged vehicles, wreckage, and structures scattered across the map. The server has a number of notable features, such as:

1. Scrap Beacons: You MUST place a Scrap Beacon on any Grid you wish to protect from auto-cleanup scripts. You MUST ALSO ensure that you change the default name of grids, and take full ownership. Losing grids because you left a block owned by 'Nobody', 'Haircut', or 'The Factorum' is not something tha Admins can help you with - it is your own responsibility.
2. Restricted Build Menu: Many blocks are unavailable to players, forcing them to scavenge for working parts.
3. Dilapidated Structures and Wreckage: Players will find wrecked vehicles and buildings that they can dismantle and repurpose for their survival efforts.
4. Minimal Jetpack: The jetpack is almost useless, which encourages creative engineering solutions for mobility.
5. Mods and Scripts: Quality of Life (QoL) mods like Build Vision and Advanced Welding are integrated to enhance gameplay.
6. Quantum Hangar: Please make sure to use the Quantum hanger to store unused vehicles. '!h save', '!h list', and '!h load' are your friends. It is advised NOT to put Bases in the Hangar - it never ends well.
7. ALE Ship Fixer: Should a Ship or Vehicle summon the Gods of Klang, this Plugin offer the Players a way to fix it themselves without the need of having an Administrator or Moderator involved. In chat, enter **!fixship** whilst looking at the grid you wish to fix.
