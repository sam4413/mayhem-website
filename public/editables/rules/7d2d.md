## 7 Days To Die Server Rules & PvP Guidelines

### 🔧 General Rules

    No Duping, X-raying, or Exploiting
    Glitches, cheats, and exploits are strictly forbidden.

    No Third-Party Tools or Hacks
    Any external tools or software that give unfair advantages will result in a ban.

    No Staff Impersonation
    Pretending to be an admin or moderator is not tolerated.

    No Building in or Claiming POIs/Prefabs
    Points of Interest (POIs) and prefabs must remain untouched and unclaimed.

    Do Not Block Roadways
    Base structures must not obstruct roads or public paths.

    No Destroying Loot Containers in POIs
    Preserve gameplay for others—don’t grief loot spawns.

    Tree Limit Per Base
    Maximum of 5 planted trees per base to reduce server lag.

    No Floating Bases
    All structures must be grounded and realistic.

### ⚔️ PvP Rules of Engagement (Must Read)

    No PvP at Any Trader Zones
    Trader areas are safe zones. PvP here is prohibited.

    Bag Despawning is Allowed
    After combat, despawning a player’s bag is permitted, regardless of location.

    No Public Accusations of Cheating
    Suspect a cheater? Open a ticket on Discord with evidence (screenshots/logs).

    No Raiding or Stealing
    Bases are off-limits—no damaging or looting another player's base.

    No Base Camping
    You may kill someone at their base once, but repeated kills at/around their base—especially by higher-level players—is considered griefing and is not allowed.

### 📜 PvP Guidelines (Must Read)

    No PvP at Trader Zones
    Repeated for clarity—these are safe areas.

    Don’t Trust Strangers
    Do not add random players to your party or friends list unless you trust them.

    Revenge Over Salt
    Getting killed? Don’t complain—get even.

    Bag Ownership After Death
    If someone kills you and takes your bag, it's theirs. Don’t whine about dying while retrieving it.

    Use Your LCB Wisely
    You get one giant Land Claim Block (LCB) to protect your base. If your base isn’t claimed and someone raids it, it’s on you.

    Anything Outside the LCB is Fair Game
    Items or structures outside your claim can be destroyed or looted.

    Lock Your Stuff
    Doors and containers are unlocked by default—lock them! If items are stolen due to being left open, they will not be refunded. Players who break into locked bases will be banned.

### Failure to follow these rules may result in warnings or permanent bans.
